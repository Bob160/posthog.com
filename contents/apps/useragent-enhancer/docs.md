## What does the Useragent Enhancer app do?
This app enhances events to include browser details when the event has a `$useragent` property. This enables off-loading, retrieving and parsing of user agent strings at ingestion.

It's typically used to easily pass the `User-Agent` HTTP header from incoming requests.

## How do I install the Useragent Enhancer app?

1. Visit the "Apps" page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'Useragent Enhancer' and select the app, press Install.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to configure the app.
