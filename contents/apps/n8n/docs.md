## What does the n8n Connector app do?

This n8n app enables you to automate PostHog workflows and create workflows using other services, using n8n. 

## How do I get started with the n8n Connector app?

The n8n app is an API integration. You will need a [PostHog Personal API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api), which must be [authenticated with n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/) in order to [connect n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.posthog/#basic-operations) and get started.

For more information, please check [n8n's integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/#posthog).

We love feature requests and feedback! Please [create an issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+feature&template=feature_request.md) to tell us what you think. 

## What if my question isn't answered above?

You can [join the PostHog Community Slack group](/slack) to ask more questions, or get advice on developing your own PostHog apps.
