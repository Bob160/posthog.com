## How do I install the Downsampling app?

1. Visit the "Apps" page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'Downsampling' and select the app, press Install.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to configure the app.

## Can I use the Downsampling app to control my PostHog bill?

Yes. Paid-for versions of PostHog are priced per event and the Downsampling app enables you to reduce the number of events which your instance ingests, thereby giving you greater control over billing.

## What if I have feedback on this app?

We love feature requests and feedback! Please [create an issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+feature&template=feature_request.md) to tell us what you think. 

## What if my question isn't answered above?

You can [join the PostHog Community Slack group](/slack) to ask more questions, or get advice on developing your own PostHog apps.
