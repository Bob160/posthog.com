YC is seen as the world's best 3 month accelerator program. Yet, no one really talks about what happens afterwards. There are now X00 companies above $150m valuation - that's a large community.

!> PostHog did YCombinator's Winter 2020 batch. We made the top companies list a year later when we closed a series B led by YC Continuity. We provide open source product analytics.

So, what have the last two years like been for us, and how could they have been better?

## The network

It's a vague term, what does this _actually_ mean?

The tools we have are an internal forum, dozens of unofficial YC Whatsapp/Slack groups filled with other founders, and the contact details of all the partners. As well as in real life friends we met whilst we were there and having their details. We've attended informal meetups through these too.

A benefit of many networks is emotional support, but being closely connected to other founders is both good and bad. We've seen people we know well create multi billion dollar companies from scratch. We should take lessons from them, but shouldn't blindly raise money as fast as possible to "compete" on valuation.

Access is another benefit. This is huge during the batch - as Silicon Valley outisders, we really knew no one. YC helped us create an initial network. Later on, this benefit shifted from helping us meeting angel investors or a few funds, to helping us interact more smoothly with other companies. Getting stuck in a dumb customer support loop? See if it's a YC company and you've got the founder's contact details. Batphone mode engaged.

The network brings customers. We're 100% inbound, so this isn't really a big deal, but from time to time, the founder of a growth stage company will find and message us because of YCombinator. They tend to give better (more direct) feedback when things aren't working, and are naturally a little more understanding. We have a particularly large number of other YC companies using us, and due to all the advantage of the program, many of these will grow hugely and become big customers in the future - we imagine.

## Investor reviews

YC has a database that provies anonymized investor reviews written by founders about their experiences during fundraising. The fact this comes from within a trusted network means it'd be hard to replicate something from outside.

It was crucial to us in raising a seed round - we didn't know anyone and used it to build trust and to figure out who had the best reputation. However, now we're a post series B company, we have met many investors many times. We've also now got a large network of existing investors, and can easily reference check potential future partners.

At the same time, there are fewer reviews of later stage companies - as there are naturally nowhere near so many of them.

Overall, this isn't as important later on, but it is nice as a quick due diligence check

## Office hours

During the YC batch, every company is offered office hours. These

Quite simply, this continues afterwards.

The partners' experience varies a lot. Many of the longer term partners are world experts in getting to product market fit - they have seen more people than anyone else do this. Many have worked with several hundred companies.

The quantity of partners that can deliver relevant advice to scaling is lower - scaling PostHog is quite different to scaling supersonic air flight . However, there *are* many visiting partners that will meet with you - they bring deeper operating experience.

It's very normal to do way fewer office hours when you're later. Early on, you'll be debating existentially if your product will/has product market fit. Later on, you'll tend to be waiting on work to get done to progress "customers are asking for X, we're trying to ship X, and it's more complex as we're much larger (although we try very hard to get faster as we get bigger not slower, there's just a backlog of actionable great feedback to implement)".

TODO: insert a bunch of examples

VC firms look like they've experience in , but many are not operational experts - and the advice comes across as vague and high level as a result. That's ok - the first reason they exist is to finance... being particularly good at running businesses is an added plus.


- Community.
  - UK founders
  - Open source founders
- Office hours.
- Investment.
- Recruitment.
- Angel investing opportunities.
  - I did two of these then figured it was a distraction. If you were into it, I think this could be really appealing.

##Â What could be better?

- There's inherent conflict between the Growth fund and external investors. Ie they want into good companies. Not an easy solve since the grwoth fund is aweosme and working with them has massively outweighed this.
- We help dozens (probably 30+) of other companies. They'll implement the same learnings as us. This makes it a bit harder to stand out. However, it's good karma and we benefited from those before us.

## Conclusion

- There's a lot of ongoing support. A lot of this is provided through network effects so it scales surprisingly well.
- Most importantly, it has changed how we see ourselves.
