Whether or not you pay to use PostHog, you can always find help at:

## Documentation

We have extensive [docs](/docs) on how to deploy and use PostHog, which are updated almost every day. You can also find answers to more general questions in the PostHog [FAQ](/faq).

## Community Slack

For general product support, join our [community Slack](/slack) group - 1,800 members and counting! It is by far the quickest way to get help from the community.
